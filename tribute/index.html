        <p class="lede">In the post–Civil War South one man made it his mission to use agricultural chemistry and
            scientific methodology to improve the lives of impoverished farmers.</p>
        <p>George Washington Carver (ca. 1864–1943) was born enslaved in Missouri at the time of the Civil War. His
            exact birth date and year are unknown, and reported dates range between 1860 and 1865. He was orphaned as an
            infant, and, with the war bringing an end to slavery, he grew up a free child, albeit on the farm of his
            mother’s former master, Moses Carver. The Carvers raised George and gave him their surname. Early on he
            developed a keen interest in plants, collecting specimens in the woods on the farm.<br>

        <h2>Timeline of George Carver's life (notable events)</h2> 
        <p>At age 11, Carver left home to pursue an education in the nearby town of Neosho. He was taken in by an
            African American couple, Mariah and Andrew Watkins, for whom he did odd jobs while attending school for the
            first time. Disappointed in the school in Neosho, Carver eventually left for Kansas, where for several years
            he supported himself through a variety of occupations and added to his education in a piecemeal fashion. He
            eventually earned a high school diploma in his twenties, but he soon found that opportunities to attend
            college for young black men in Kansas were nonexistent. So in the late 1880s Carver relocated again, this
            time to Iowa, where he met the Milhollands, a white couple who encouraged him to enroll in college.</p>
